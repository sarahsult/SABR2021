# SABR2021

The attached scripts represent ways Wash U's 2021 SABR Diamond Dollars Case Comp team implemented their new pitching metric. The first script is what we were able to make work in time for the presentation. The other script is an attempt and pre sorting the data to make the function run quicker, therefore allowing us to use a larger sample size. This is not the script we used for our results in the presentation.
